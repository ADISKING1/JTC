# [Play it here! :video_game:](https://adisking1.itch.io/jamming-the-curve) 

# This game was made under 2 weeks for "JTC Game Jam".

This is a game where I challenge the player with a series of questions, these questions are in three forms:
* Firstly good old Myth-busters
* Secondly a Quiz and 
* Thirdly another quiz but with questions that force the player to understand various aspects and make them curious/aware of the topic.

After every answer you get more insight regarding that question from credible sources.
